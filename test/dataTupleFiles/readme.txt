Running DATASLEUTH as a userjob using the dataTupler requires putting the CMSSW
tarball (and pset) into the dataTuple/userdir folder. You can make it using the
script provided there, and by modifying the pset to have the appropriate
"SUPPLY" variables (which are there for sed later). It is also convenient to
include them here, so I have done this. Copy them over into dataTuple/userdir.
